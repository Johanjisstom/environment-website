            <h2>Pollution</h2>
            
            
            <p>Pollution is the contamination of air, water, or land by harmful substances, making it unsafe for humans and wildlife.

                Types & Causes:
                
                Air pollution: from vehicles, factories, and burning fuels.
                
                Water pollution: from industrial waste, oil spills, and plastic dumping.
                
                Soil pollution: from pesticides, fertilizers, and waste disposal.
                
                Noise and light pollution: from cities and industries.
                
                Effects:
                
                Health problems like asthma, cancer, and heart disease.
                
                Death of aquatic life due to water contamination.
                
                Acid rain damaging buildings, forests, and crops.
                
                Reduced air quality and climate warming.
                
                Loss of biodiversity and soil fertility.
                
                Solutions:
                
                Reduce, reuse, recycle to cut down waste.
                
                Use cleaner fuels and promote public transport.
                
                Treat industrial waste before releasing it into the environment.
                
                Ban single-use plastics.

        <div class="tab-content hidden" id="biodiversity">
            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
            
            <p>Biodiversity means the variety of all living things on Earth — plants, animals, and microorganisms — and the ecosystems they form. It’s vital for balance in nature.

                Causes of Loss:
                
                Deforestation and habitat destruction.
                
                Pollution (air, water, soil).
                
                Climate change altering natural habitats.
                
                Overhunting and overfishing.
                
                Invasive species that threaten native wildlife.
                
                Effects:
                
                Ecosystem imbalance (for example, fewer pollinators like bees affect food supply).
                
                Loss of species that support human life through food, medicine, and oxygen.
                
                Reduced soil fertility and water quality.
                
                Weakened natural resilience to climate change and disasters.
                
                Solutions:
                
                Protect natural habitats and create wildlife reserves.
                
                Ban illegal hunting and trading of animals.
                
                Reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
                
                Promote sustainable farming and fishing.
                
                Raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity.</p>

        <div class="tab-content hidden" id="deforestation">
            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            
            
            <p>Deforestation is the large-scale cutting down of forests for farming, mining, or urban growth.

                Causes:
                
                Agriculture expansion (for crops like soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching).
                
                Logging for timber and paper.
                
                Urbanization and infrastructure development.
                
                Mining and industrial projects.
                
                Effects:
                
                Loss of biodiversity — many animals and plants lose their homes.
                
                Increased carbon dioxide in the air, worsening climate change.
                
                Soil erosion and poor water quality.
                
                Loss of livelihoods for communities that depend on forests.
                
                Solutions:
                
                Reforestation and afforestation (planting new trees).
                
                Sustainable forestry and farming practices.
                
                Reducing paper and wood waste.
                
                Protecting forest areas through laws.
                
                Supporting eco-friendly products that don’t cause deforestation.</p>

        <div class="tab-content hidden" id="climate-change">
            <h2>Climate Change</h2>

            Climate change refers to long-term changes in the Earth’s temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns — mainly caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

            <p>Causes:

                Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for electricity, transport, and industry.
                
                Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide.
                
                Agriculture, especially livestock farming, which releases methane.
                
                Industrial emissions from factories.
                
                Effects:
                
                Rising global temperatures leading to more heatwaves and droughts.
                
                Melting glaciers and rising sea levels, threatening coastal areas.
                
                Extreme weather events like floods, storms, and wildfires.
                
                Food and water shortages due to changing weather patterns.
                
                Health risks such as heat-related illnesses and spreading diseases.
                
                Solutions:
                
                Switch to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro).
                
                Reduce fossil fuel use and promote electric transport.
                
                Plant trees and protect forests.
                
                Recycle and reduce waste to lower emissions.
